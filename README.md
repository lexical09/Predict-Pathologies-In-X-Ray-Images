# Predict-Pathologies-In-X-Ray-Images
This kernel shows you how to resize these images and load them into an array ready to feed your models. The dataset contains 14 different disease classes from the NIH Clinical Center.

The NIH Clinical Center released over 100,000 anonymized chest x-ray images and their corresponding data to the scientific community. The release will allow researchers across the country and around the world to freely access the datasets and increase their ability to teach computers how to detect and diagnose disease. Ultimately, this artificial intelligence mechanism can lead to clinicians making better diagnostic decisions for patients.

Then I used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Keras to predict each ailment based off of the X-Ray image.

The model can predict pathologies in x-ray images with an accuracy rate that is much better than random chance but there is still a lot of room for improvement.
